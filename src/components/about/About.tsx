      <p>
        The first time I learned about programming was in highschool, and I
        realized soon that it is what I want to do in my future. Currently I am
        a student at Codecool, learning full-stack development, and searching
        for my future job.
        <br />
        <br />
        In this one year at Codecool I got familiar with several programming
        languages and frameworks while making projects with different teams or
        by myself. I learned a lot about both frontend and backend. Currently I
        tend to enjoy working more on frontend projects using JavaScript with
        React, and I would like to get familiar with more frontend technologies
        (like Vue.js, TypeScript, etc) in the future.
        <br />
        <br />
        Competencies: JavaScript, React.js, CSS, Java, Spring boot, Python,
        Flask, PostgreSQL, Git
